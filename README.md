# Hangman-Game-Python
Hangman is a word-guessing game. The computer selects a random word, and the player tries to guess it letter by letter. The player has a limited number of attempts. Incorrect guesses lead to parts of a stick figure being drawn. If the player guesses the word before the figure is complete, they win.
## Project Overview: Hangman Game

### Methodology
The Hangman game was implemented using Python programming language. The core logic involves:
* Random word selection from a predefined list.
* Tracking user input (letter guesses).
* Updating the game state based on correct or incorrect guesses.
* Implementing win/loss conditions.

### Efficiency
The project prioritizes readability and maintainability over extreme performance optimization. The use of data structures like lists and strings for word representation and game state management is efficient for this scale.

### Learnings
* **Problem-solving:** Decomposing the game into smaller functions and logical steps.
* **Python fundamentals:** Effective use of data structures, control flow, and input/output operations.
* **Game development:** Understanding game mechanics and user interaction.
* **Code readability:** Writing clean and well-structured code.

### Outcomes
The project successfully creates a functional Hangman game. It demonstrates basic Python programming skills and game development concepts. The game provides a user-friendly experience with clear instructions and feedback.

### Accuracy
The game's output is accurate in determining win/loss conditions, updating the game state based on user input, and displaying the hangman figure. The accuracy of the game depends on the correctness of the word selection and input handling logic.
 
**Note:** For a more in-depth analysis, metrics like average game length, win rate, or user feedback could be collected and analyzed.
