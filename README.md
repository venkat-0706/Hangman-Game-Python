# Hangman-Game-Python
Hangman is a word-guessing game. The computer selects a random word, and the player tries to guess it letter by letter. The player has a limited number of attempts. Incorrect guesses lead to parts of a stick figure being drawn. If the player guesses the word before the figure is complete, they win.
